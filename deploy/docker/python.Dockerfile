# GENERIC TEMPLATE: Python service (Flask, FastAPI, a plain script, etc.).
# Project-agnostic: no hardcoded module names or framework assumptions
# beyond "pip install -r requirements.txt, then run one entry file."
#
# What you'd change per project — all as --build-arg flags, no editing:
#   RUNTIME_VERSION interpreter version                         (default 3.11)
#   APP_PORT        port the app listens on, and what the
#                   healthcheck probes                          (default 5000)
#   APP_ENTRY       command to launch the app                   (default "python app.py")
#   HEALTH_PATH     HTTP path to probe on localhost:APP_PORT,
#                   or "" to disable the healthcheck            (default /)
#
#   docker build --build-arg APP_PORT=5000 --build-arg APP_ENTRY="python app.py" \
#                -t my-service .
#   docker run -p 5000:5000 my-service
#
# Base image note: this uses python:*-slim (Debian/glibc), not
# python:*-alpine (musl). Data/analytics packages such as pandas, numpy, and
# duckdb only ship prebuilt "manylinux" (glibc) wheels — on Alpine, pip
# would fall back to compiling them from source, which is slow and, for
# some packages, requires a C/C++ toolchain that isn't installed here. If
# your project has no such dependencies, alpine + `apk add py3-pip` is a
# smaller alternative.
